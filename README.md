# Python Challenge #1

## Week 2 Assignment

This repository contains my Week 2 assignment, where I delved into coding for the very first time. The journey was challenging, but it allowed me to learn a great deal.

### What's Inside

In this repository, I focused on working with dictionaries and adding new items to them. I also explored two types of loops that we learned during this assignment. Notably, I applied the `match case` method as an alternative to the traditional `if-else` approach.

### Testing

I thoroughly tested the code both in my terminal and in Jupyter Notebook, and it functions as expected.

### Note on Comments

You may notice some differences in comment placement and indentation, especially in code segments involving `else:`. I retained the original comment placement, as I believe it's essential to maintain consistency with the course materials.

Feel free to explore the code and learn alongside me on this coding journey. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out. Happy coding!
